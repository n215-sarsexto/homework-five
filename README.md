This project continues the overall travel-fly project. As of this stage, we have not yet learned dynamic content. In this iteration, a hard-coded "about" page has been added. This has prompted me to better sort my code as I think about the transition of certain code onto new pages. I also had to update my font awesome icon version, which served as a good lesson in ensuring packages are updated when you are using external content. I continued working on responsive design, which prompted me to think about how to design for mobile further and what that should look like.
